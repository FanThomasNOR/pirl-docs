Fawkes: Talks about how the crypto cards work. Which are essentially pre-paid cards.  


18:00
Fawkes: Talks about concepts like SMS or email to convert to PIRL. It’s possible. All you need is the development. If you have PIRL pay. You can have direct connection from fiat to PIRL.

25:00
Fawkes: Talks about contracts between people in the marketplace and how an escrow can help solve the problem. Talks about scams on eBay. Possible solution is escrow, as its basic. It collects money form the buyer. When the buyer says product the is good. The seller receives the payment.  This system can still be exploited.
Seller reviews will help with trades. You will have a profile for reputation.
