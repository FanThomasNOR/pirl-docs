## Overview Carbonvote Mechanism

1) Who should vote?  
We believe the legitimate voters should be players who have pirls in their wallets.  
2) So we are going to count heads?  
No. We are going to count coins, in this case, pirls. How many pirls you have, how many votes you have.  
3) How to vote?  
Simply, send a 0-Pirl transaction from your wallet to the YES or NO address. The transaction itself serves as a message of the vote. The pirls under the from address of the transaction will be considered a unanimous batch of ballots that support or oppose the proposal of a hard fork. For the transactions to be done successfully, a minimum amount of transaction fee of 30,000 gas (0.0006 Pirl) is required.  
Your pirls are safe in your wallets. We won’t collect or lock money.  
4) How’s the vote counted?  
[https://pirlvote.com/#/](https://pirlvote.com/#/)  
dynamically calculates the Pirls that has gone to the two sides as the vote is going on.  
So you can change your mind, you can overwrite your vote by resending your message or move the Pirl from the addresses that have participated so as to suggest that you are abstaining from the vote as the Pirl won’t be able to be counted as votes anymore.


## Prerequisites

To vote is like a normal transaction you pick the contract address of your choice:  
### 1 ) Option 1  
No: Don’t touch anything and wait the liquidator process,
take the risk to take hard loss (think 7 million coins being dumped)
```
0x5e828A08F04de40b3b6678D254513b8f18a9a593  
```
### 2 ) Option 2  
Yes: Fork to prevent dumping and lock the cryptopia address funds to untouchable one like 0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222 .
```
0xDDb9A21045Aa7021E07Aef92a35ffcaF8bFbA51e
```
