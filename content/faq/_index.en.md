### What is PIRL?

> Pirl is a 3-layered Masternode network blockchain that harnesses the power of Smart Contracts, EVM, Web3 and service masternode networks to provide decentralized storage and immutable (read: unchangeable -secure) content. The main goal of the project is to improve the functionality and performance of Decentralized applications and set new standards for user experience and to provide a real use for blockchain technology. PIRL is using the already laid technological foundation to develop a unique all-in-one platform with easy-to-use features for file storage, communication, entertainment and p2p marketplace trading.

### How does PIRL innovate?

> The Pirl team has developed the first masternode capable of working on a DAG structured Ethash blockchain. In addition to this, Pirl brings with it a unique 3-layered Masternode service which offers a number of unique functionalities for its users. The infrastructure developed by the Pirl team brings the most complete DApp hosting solution developed to date to the table and offers dramatically improved performance and endless possibilities for developers and users alike.

### What are the benefits of hosting a DApp on PIRL?

> The currently available platforms for DApps leave a lot to be desired. Not only have these networks proved slow and expensive to use in practice, they are severely limited in their utility because they only support the transfer and processing of text data. This means that they all rely on centralized storage for DApps data. We can do better.

> By introducing a network of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) masternodes, Pirl is able to host completely decentralised apps without centralized storage. This means high volumes of data processed and stored with high efficiency, zero duplication, and with extreme resilience. Natural disasters? Systems offline? Consolidation of control of the internet? Let’s say no to all of that.

### What are PIRL's coin specifications?

> Algorithm: Dagger

> Time between blocks : 13 sec

> Total block reward : 9 PIRL

> PIRL Miner reward : 5 PIRL / block

> Masternodes : 3 PIRL / block

> Dev fund : 1 PIRL / block

> The future Block reward distribution can be found in [PIRL Monetary Policy](https://pirl.io/en/monetary-policy)!

### What is a PIRL masternode?

> Masternodes are a series of servers that underpin a blockchain’s network. They are responsible for enabling specific services that cannot be accomplished by miners using a Proof of Work system alone.

> Much like with Proof of Stake, masternodes rely on “staking” (or locking up) a certain amount of the currency within the currency’s network.  Masternodes protect blockchains from network attacks in much the same way as traditional proof of stake algorithms. It’s expensive to accumulate enough currency to create a masternode, and prohibitively expensive to accumulate enough currency to have a monopoly on the entire masternode network. This cost of operation also helps to keep operators honest and invested in the future of the coin, incentivising them to properly maintain their masternodes.

> Once it is live, the masternode accommodates a unique series of functions. For Pirl, these functions include Content Storage, Communication, Entertainment products, and P2P market trading.

### What is the 3-layer PIRL masternode network?

> Pirl will run 3 separate Masternode types. Each of these serves a different purpose. Premium masternodes encompass the features of both of the other masternodes, while also supporting aspects of the Pirl Network such as peering, and consensus.

> Storage Masternodes provide digital downloads for the marketplace, and can be used as a backup file server for individuals and organizations.

> Content Masternodes provide publicly accessible file storage for the media needed for dApps and the marketplace to function.

> For more information see the [PIRL whitepaper](https://storage.gra1.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_33a0c4ac73cf4d88a243480c275be8ac/pirl/pirl-whitepaper.pdf)

### What will be traded on the PIRL masterplace?

> The possibilities for the market are nearly endless. You will be able to buy and sell almost any product or service (provided it’s legal, of course!).

> The marketplace will also allow dApps, smart contract developers, and artists to sell their intellectual property.

### How will the PIRL marketplace protect traders?

> Trades in the marketplace will be protected through escrow smart-contracts, which enable trustless transactions with no risk of loss to the parties involved. Assigned moderators will also be able to verify that everything is running smoothly.

### What is PirlPoseidon?

> [Poseidon](https://poseidon.pirl.io/) is an all-in-one platform that gives users access to all of Pirl’s unique features and capabilities in one web location.

### What is PirlTube?

> [PirlTube] (https://pirltube.com) is the distributed video sharing hosted on the Pirl masternode networks and backed up via smart contracts to the blockchain.

### What is the PIRL max supply?

> The maximum supply of Pirl is approximately 157,000,000 coins. See the Pirl Monetary Policy for more information: [PIRL Monetary Policy](https://pirl.io/en/monetary-policy)

### Did PIRL have an ICO or a premine?

> Absolutely not. Pirl strives to not be considered security by broadly avoiding actions which may lead to confusing that distinction.

### Will PIRL ever change from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS)?

> The main PIRL chain will forever remain PoW.  Side chains may utilize the benefits of PoS where it makes sense for the design.
