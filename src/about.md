# About Pirl 2.0

Pirl has migrated from it's original protocol ( ethash ) and it's now based on substrate. 

Pirl 2.0 is fully decentralised and is managed
by the community using democracy modules.

This new version of Pirl is a continuity of the initial idea. 
The major changes are:

- New monetary policy
- decentralised treasury
- validation of the blockchain using Validator node
- staking ( you can nominate a validator and stake on top of it )
