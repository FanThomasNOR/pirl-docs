<p>Beside the official DApp APIs interface go-pirl
has support for additional management APIs. Similar to the DApp APIs, these are also provided using
<a href="http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification">JSON-RPC</a> and follow exactly the same conventions. Pirl comes
with a console client which has support for all additional APIs described here.</p>

<h2 id="enabling-the-management-apis">Enabling the management APIs</h2>

<p>To offer these APIs over the Pirl RPC endpoints, please specify them with the <code>--${interface}api</code>
command line argument (where <code>${interface}</code> can be <code>rpc</code> for the HTTP endpoint, <code>ws</code> for the WebSocket
endpoint and <code>ipc</code> for the unix socket (Unix) or named pipe (Windows) endpoint).</p>

<p>For example: <code>Pirl --ipcapi admin,eth,miner --rpcapi eth,web3 --rpc</code></p>

<ul>
<li>Enables the admin, official DApp and miner API over the IPC interface</li>
<li>Enables the official DApp and web3 API over the HTTP interface</li>
</ul>

<p>The HTTP RPC interface must be explicitly enabled using the <code>--rpc</code> flag.</p>

<p>Please note, offering an API over the HTTP (<code>rpc</code>) or WebSocket (<code>ws</code>) interfaces will give everyone
access to the APIs who can access this interface (DApps, browser tabs, etc). Be careful which APIs
you enable. By default Pirl enables all APIs over the IPC (<code>ipc</code>) interface and only the <code>db</code>, <code>eth</code>,
<code>net</code> and <code>web3</code> APIs over the HTTP and WebSocket interfaces.</p>

<p>To determine which APIs an interface provides, the <code>modules</code> JSON-RPC method can be invoked. For
example over an <code>ipc</code> interface on unix systems:</p>

<pre><code>echo '{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;rpc_modules&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[],&quot;id&quot;:1}' | nc -U $datadir/Pirl.ipc
</code></pre>

<p>will give all enabled modules including the version number:</p>

<pre><code>{  
   &quot;id&quot;:1,
   &quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,
   &quot;result&quot;:{  
      &quot;admin&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;db&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;debug&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;eth&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;miner&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;net&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;personal&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;shh&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;txpool&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;,
      &quot;web3&quot;:&quot;1.0&quot;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="consuming-the-management-apis">Consuming the management APIs</h2>

<p>These additional APIs follow the same conventions as the official DApp APIs. Web3 can be
used to consume these additional APIs.</p>

<p><strong>2 examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Console: <code>miner.start()</code></p></li>

<li><p>IPC: <code>echo '{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;miner_start&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[],&quot;id&quot;:1}' | nc -U $datadir/Pirl.ipc</code></p></li>

<li><p>HTTP: <code>curl -X POST --data '{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;miner_start&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[],&quot;id&quot;:74}' localhost:8545</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>With the number of THREADS as an arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Console: <code>miner.start(4)</code></p></li>

<li><p>IPC: <code>echo '{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;miner_start&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[4],&quot;id&quot;:1}' | nc -U $datadir/Pirl.ipc</code></p></li>

<li><p>HTTP: <code>curl -X POST --data '{&quot;jsonrpc&quot;:&quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;method&quot;:&quot;miner_start&quot;,&quot;params&quot;:[4],&quot;id&quot;:74}' localhost:8545</code></p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="list-of-management-apis">List of management APIs</h2>

<p>Beside the officially exposed DApp API namespaces (<code>eth</code>, <code>shh</code>, <code>web3</code>), Pirl provides the following
extra management API namespaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>admin</code>: Pirl node management</li>
<li><code>debug</code>: Pirl node debugging</li>
<li><code>miner</code>: Miner and DAG</li>
<li><code>personal</code>: Account management</li>
<li><code>txpool</code>: Transaction pool inspection</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="admin">Admin</h2>

<p>The <code>admin</code> API gives you access to several non-standard RPC methods, which will allow you to have
a fine grained control over your Pirl instance, including but not limited to network peer and RPC
endpoint management.</p>

<h3 id="admin-addpeer">admin_addPeer</h3>

<p>The <code>addPeer</code> administrative method requests adding a new remote node to the list of tracked static
nodes. The node will try to maintain connectivity to these nodes at all times, reconnecting every
once in a while if the remote connection goes down.</p>

<p>The method accepts a single argument, the &lsquo;enode&rsquo;
URL of the remote peer to start tracking and returns a <code>BOOL</code> indicating whether the peer was accepted
for tracking or some error occurred.</p>

would depend on the current – to the user unknown – working directory of Pirl), and returns the
version string reported by <code>solc --version</code>.</p>

<h4 id="javascript-based-tracing">JavaScript-based tracing</h4>

<p>Specifying the <code>tracer</code> option in the second argument enables JavaScript-based tracing. In this mode, <code>tracer</code> is interpreted as a JavaScript expression that is expected to evaluate to an object with (at least) two methods, named <code>step</code> and <code>result</code>.</p>

<p><code>step</code>is a function that takes two arguments, log and db, and is called for each step of the EVM, or when an error occurs, as the specified transaction is traced.</p>

<p><code>log</code> has the following fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>pc</code>: Number, the current program counter</li>
<li><code>op</code>: Object, an OpCode object representing the current opcode</li>
<li><code>gas</code>: Number, the amount of gas remaining</li>
<li><code>gasPrice</code>: Number, the cost in wei of each unit of gas</li>
<li><code>memory</code>: Object, a structure representing the contract&rsquo;s memory space</li>
<li><code>stack</code>: array[big.Int], the EVM execution stack</li>
<li><code>depth</code>: The execution depth</li>
<li><code>account</code>: The address of the account executing the current operation</li>
<li><code>err</code>: If an error occured, information about the error</li>
</ul>

<p>If <code>err</code> is non-null, all other fields should be ignored.</p>

<p>For efficiency, the same <code>log</code> object is reused on each execution step, updated with current values; make sure to copy values you want to preserve beyond the current call. For instance, this step function will not work:</p>

<pre><code>function(log) {
  this.logs.append(log);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But this step function will:</p>

<pre><code>function(log) {
  this.logs.append({gas: log.gas, pc: log.pc, ...});
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>log.op</code> has the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>isPush()</code> - returns true iff the opcode is a PUSHn</li>
<li><code>toString()</code> - returns the string representation of the opcode</li>
<li><code>toNumber()</code> - returns the opcode&rsquo;s number</li>
</ul>

<p><code>log.memory</code> has the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>slice(start, stop)</code> - returns the specified segment of memory as a byte slice</li>
<li><code>length()</code> - returns the length of the memory</li>
</ul>

<p><code>log.stack</code> has the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>peek(idx)</code> - returns the idx-th element from the top of the stack (0 is the topmost element) as a big.Int</li>
<li><code>length()</code> - returns the number of elements in the stack</li>
</ul>

<p><code>db</code> has the following methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>getBalance(address)</code> - returns a <code>big.Int</code> with the specified account&rsquo;s balance</li>
<li><code>getNonce(address)</code> - returns a Number with the specified account&rsquo;s nonce</li>
<li><code>getCode(address)</code> - returns a byte slice with the code for the specified account</li>
<li><code>getState(address, hash)</code> - returns the state value for the specified account and the specified hash</li>
<li><code>exists(address)</code> - returns true if the specified address exists</li>
</ul>

<p>The second function, &lsquo;result&rsquo;, takes no arguments, and is expected to return a JSON-serializable value to return to the RPC caller.</p>

<p>If the step function throws an exception or executes an illegal operation at any point, it will not be called on any further VM steps, and the error will be returned to the caller.</p>

<p>Note that several values are Golang big.Int objects, not JavaScript numbers or JS bigints. As such, they have the same interface as described in the godocs. Their default serialization to JSON is as a Javascript number; to serialize large numbers accurately call <code>.String()</code> on them. For convenience, <code>big.NewInt(x)</code> is provided, and will convert a uint to a Go BigInt.</p>

<p>Usage example, returns the top element of the stack at each CALL opcode only:</p>

<pre><code>debug.traceTransaction(txhash, {tracer: '{data: [], step: function(log) { if(log.op.toString() == &quot;CALL&quot;) this.data.push(log.stack.peek(0)); }, result: function() { return this.data; }}'});

If the passphrase can be used to decrypt the private key belogging to <code>tx.from</code> the transaction is verified, signed and send onto the network. The account is not unlocked globally in the node and cannot be used in other RPC calls.</p>

<p>The sign method calculates an Pirl specific signature with:
<code>sign(keccack256(&quot;\x19Pirl Signed Message:\n&quot; + len(message) + message)))</code>.</p>

<p>By adding a prefix to the message makes the calculated signature recognisable as an Pirl specific signature. This prevents misuse where a malicious DApp can sign arbitrary data (e.g. transaction) and use the signature to impersonate the victim.</p>

<p>See ecRecover to verify the signature.</p>

<h2 id="txpool">Txpool</h2>

<p>The <code>txpool</code> API gives you access to several non-standard RPC methods to inspect the contents of the
transaction pool containing all the currently pending transactions as well as the ones queued for
future processing.</p>

<h3 id="txpool-content">txpool_content</h3>

<p>The <code>content</code> inspection property can be queried to list the exact details of all the transactions
currently pending for inclusion in the next block(s), as well as the ones that are being scheduled
for future execution only.</p>

<p>The result is an object with two fields <code>pending</code> and <code>queued</code>. Each of these fields are associative
arrays, in which each entry maps an origin-address to a batch of scheduled transactions. These batches
themselves are maps associating nonces with actual transactions.</p>

<p>Please note, there may be multiple transactions associated with the same account and nonce. This can
happen if the user broadcast mutliple ones with varying gas allowances (or even complerely different
transactions).</p>

<p>The <code>status</code> inspection property can be queried for the number of transactions currently pending for
inclusion in the next block(s), as well as the ones that are being scheduled for future execution only.</p>

<p>The result is an object with two fields <code>pending</code> and <code>queued</code>, each of which is a counter representing
the number of transactions in that particular state.</p>
